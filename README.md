##  Objective

This will (hopefully) one day be a fully fleshed out recipe & menu creation App. There are two basic ideas behind it:

### 1. Improving one's cooking skills through iteration

There are enough recipe sites/apps out there already. But what a lot of them don't seem to focus on, is customising/tweaking a recipe to your specific tastes and skills. Not only that, but if I look at the amazing dishes my grandma regularly makes, I noticed she only really has about 20-30 recipes she knows by heart, doesn't need to look up in a book and that are family favourites. 

It's easy to look up/try new recipes anytime online/in a book, but what about curating your own collection of favourite dishes you love to make AND eat? 

I improve most efficiently if I repeat a dish/recipe with only minor changes from one version to the other, I thought that this might be an interesting concept to incorporate into a recipe collection that's utterly personal to the user. 

No social aspect, just a highly personal collection of recipes you love, or are trying to perfect. So, in essence, cook like a programmer :D 

This is the first part I'll try to build.

### 2. Easily generating/maintaining an 'Eternal Menu'

Assuming you've used the iterative approach to cooking to generate recipes you truly love, then over time you will have built up a cook book filled with personal favourites. The next logical step for me would be to create weekly menus from your recipes. Several factors are important for this, though: 

- what season is it and what vegetables are available right now?
- how much time do you have that week? Will you only manage to whip up 30min dishes or is it holiday season and you want to spend time in your kitchen?
- which days of the week are you able to/need to cook? 
- is there a food platter (e.g. fish on Fridays) that you'd like to see repeated in your menu?

All these filters make your recipe collection a prime candidate for creative programming! If one does not want to think a lot about what you're going to make throughout the rest of the week, then applying filters should make the creation of a menu easier to manage.
